# Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax
Ai designed to win/draw a game of Tic Tac Toe, which was made using Pygame. It uses a minimaxing algorithm, originally with some bias for the starting moves and blocking, but later fixed. Tested using both real human players and by pitting the AI against itself, all testing has resulted in a win or a draw for the AI.
